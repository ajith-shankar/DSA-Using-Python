# Given an integer X, find its square root. If X is not a perfect square, then return floor(âˆšx).
#
# Examples :
#
# Input: x = 4
# Output: 2
# Explanation: The square root of 4 is 2.
#
# Input: x = 11
# Output: 3
# Explanation:  The square root of 11 lies in between 3 and 4 so floor of the square root is 3.
